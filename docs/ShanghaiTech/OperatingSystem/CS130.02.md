# OS Services and Structures

## Operrating System Services

- Operating systems provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users
- One set of operating-system services provides functions that are helpful to the user:
	- **User interface** - Almost all operating systems have a user interface (UI).
		- Varies between Command-Line (CLI), Graphics User Interface (GUI), touch-screen, Batch
	- **Program execution** - The system must be able to load a program into memory and to run that program, end execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error)
	- **I/O operations** - A running program may require I/O, which may involve a file or an I/O device
	- **File-system manipulation** - The file system is of particular interest. Programs need to read and write files and directories, create and delete them, **search** them, **list** file Information, **permission management**.

	- **Communications** - Processes may exchange information, on the same computer or between computers over a network (IPC: internal procedure call / RPC: remote procedure call)
		- Communications may be via **shared memory** or through **message passing** (packets moved by the OS)
	- **Error detection** - OS needs to be constantly aware of possible errors
		- May occur in the CPU and memory hardware, in I/O devices, in user program
		- For each type of error, OS should take the appropriate action to *ensure correct and consistent computing*
		- Debugging facilities can greatly enhance the user's and programmer's abilities to efficiently use the system
- Another set of OS functions exists for ensuring the efficient operation of the system itself via resource sharing
	- **Resource allocation** - When multiple users or multiple jobs running concurrently, resources must be allocated to each of them
		- Many types of resources - CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, l/O devices.
	- **Logging** - To keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources
		- Eg. `top` can monitor the usage information of resources
	- **Protection and security** - The owners of information stored in a multiuser or networked computer system may want to control use of that information, concurrent processes should not interfere with each other
		- **Protection** involves ensuring that all access to system resources is **controlled**
		- **Security** of the system from outsiders requires user **authentication**, extends to defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts

## System Calls

- Programming interface to the services provided by the OS
- Typically written in a high-level language (C or C++)
- Mostly accessed by programs via a high-level **Application Programming Interface (API)** rather than direct system call use
	- Eg. `libc` on Linux
- Three most common APIs are **Win32 API** for Windows, **POSIX** API for POSIX-based systems (including virtually all versions of UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS X), and **Java API** for the Java virtual machine (JVM)

### Types of System Calls

- Process control
	- create process, terminate process
		- For UNIX: Create = fork, terminate: exit
	- end, abort
	- load, execute
	- get process attributes, set process attributes
	- wait for time
		- For UNIX: wait
	- wait event, signal event
	- allocate and free memory
	- Dump memory if error
	- **Debugger** for determining **bugs, single step** execution
	- **Locks** for managing access to shared data between processes
- File management: UNIX: open, read, write, close
	- create file, delete file
	- open, close file
	- read, write, reposition
	- get and set file attributes
- Device management: UNIX: ioctl, read, write
	- request device, release device
	- read, write, reposition
	- get device attributes, set device attributes
	- logically attach or detach devices
- Information maintenance Eg. getpid...
	- get time or date, set time or date
	- get system data, set system data
	- get and set process, file, or device attributes
- Communications Eg. pipe, nmap
	- create, delete communication connection
	- send, receive messages if **message passing model** to **host** name or **process name**
		- From client to server
	- **Shared-memory model** create and gain access to memory regions
	- transfer status information
	- attach and detach remote devices
- Protection Eg. umask, chown
	- Control access to resources
	- Get and set permissions
	- Allow and deny user access

## Architecture Examples

### MS-DOS Execution (Single Tasking OS)

- Command interpreter = special program = shell (cshell, korn shell)
	- Created at First Login / Program launch
	- Execute User-specified command

### UNIX system structure

- UNIX -
	- Limited hardware functionality -> the original UNIX operating system had limited structuring
	- UNIX OS consists of two separable parts
- Systems programs
- The kernel
	- Everything **below the *system-call interface* and above the *physical hardware***
	- Provides
		- File system
		- CPU scheduling
		- Memory management
		- Etc.
	- A large number of functions for **one level** 同一层 / Same address base

### Communication Models

- Message Passing
	- Through Kernel (System Call)
- Shared Memory
	- 开销更低

### Layered Approach

> [!question] VS Monolithic Design?

- The operating system is divided into a number of layers (levels), each built on top of lower layers. The bottom layer (layer 0), is the hardware; the highest (layer N) is the user interface.
- With modularity, layers are selected such that each uses functions (operations) and services of only lower-level layers

> ![../res/Pasted image 20240229163544.png](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240229163544.png)

- High-level layers can invoke low-level layers
- Friendlier to modify / maintain
- BUT **high performance overhead**
