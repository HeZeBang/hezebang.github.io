# OS and Architecture Overview

## Operating System

- Software (!= Application Program)
- Resource Manager / Allocator
- Control User Program

## Review: Architecture - CA1

- Device Controller
	- Have Local Buffer Storage & Register
		- Data movement / exchange
	- Device Driver
		- Understand the function
		- Provide uniform interface -> interact with CPU (through interrupt)

Async Interaction!!!

Decide Cycle order!!!

### Computer System Organization

- I/O devices and the CPU can execute concurrently
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
- Each device controller has a local buffer
- Each device controller type has an operating system ==device driver== to manage it
- CPU moves data **from/to main memory to/from local buffers**
- I/O is from the device to local buffer of controller
- Device controller informs CPU that it has **finished** its operation by causing an ==interrupt==

### Common Functions of Interrupts

- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the ==interrupt vector== *中断向量表*, which contains the addresses of **all the service routines**
- Interrupt architecture must save the **address** of the interrupted instruction
- A ==trap== or ==exception== is a **software-generated** interrupt caused either by an error or a user request
	- Error -> Exception
	- User request -> Trap
	- Will review at SysRq
- An operating system is **interrupt driven**
	- 4 kinds of interrupt

### Storage Device Hierarchy

![Pasted image 20240227160117](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240227160117.png)

- Primary Storage (Lost when power off) CPU can access
	- Registers
	- Cache
	- Main Memory
- Secondary Storage
	- 1
	- 2
- 3rd
	- 1
	- 2

### Performance of various levels of storage

- Level ++
- Size --
- Access time ++
- Bandwidth --
- Different Manager

### Caching

- Important principle, performed at many levels in a computer (in hardware, operating system, software)
- Information in use copied ==from slower to faster== storage **temporarily**
- Faster storage (cache) checked ==first== to determine if information is there
	- If it is, information used **directly from the cache** (fast)
	- If not, data **copied to cache and used there**
- Cache **smaller** than storage being cached
	- **Cache management** important design problem
	- **Cache size and replacement policy**
- Why does cache work?
	- **Temporal Locality**: a program is likely to access data it has just **recently accessed**
		- **Loop**
	- **Spatial Locality**: a program is likely to access data that are close to what have just been accessed
		- **Array**
- Requires a *cache management* policy
- Caching introduces another level in storage hierarchy.
	- This requires data that is simultaneously stored in more than one level to be *consistent*
		- For data in different layers

> [!exercise] 
> Suppose each cache access takes 2 ns and each
memory (i.e., RAM) access takes 200 ns. What is the
minimum cache hit ratio we need in order to achieve no
more than 20ns average memory access time?

> Let $p$ denote hit ratio, the average memory access time is  
> $p* 2 + (1-p)*202 < 20$
> 
> - $p$ means the possibility to hit at cache
> - $1-p$ means the possibility to hit at memory (cache miss)

### Data transfer on the bus

![Pasted image 20240227161830](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240227161830.png)

Cache-memory: cache misses, write-through/write-back
Memory-disk: swapping, paging, file accesses
Memory-NIC: packet send/receive
I/O devices to the processor: interrupts (DMA completion, packet arrival)

### DMA / Direct Memory Access

- Bulk data transfer memory <-> l/O device (disk, network interface) **initiated by processor** ==without the need of CPU==
	- address of I/O device
	- starting location in memory
	- number of bytes
- direction of transfer (read/write from/to memory)
- Processor **interrupted** when operation **completes**
- **Bus arbitration** between cache-memory and DMA transfers
- Memory cache must be **consistent with DMA**

## Back to OS

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { application (user) } \\
\hline \text { operating system } \\
\hline
\text { hardware }
\end{gathered}
$$

- A software layer
	- between hardware and application programs/users,
	- provides a **virtual machine** interface
		- easy to use (hides complexity)
		- safe (**prevents and handles** errors)
- Acts as **resource manager**
	- allows programs/users to share hardware resources
	- in a protected way: fair and efficient

> - Bootstrap Program
> 	- In **firmware**
> 	- Launch when Boot
> 	- Bootstrap Initialize OS & OS Load Data -> Kernel -> Memory

> Resource? Also with process management (广义的概念)

### How does OS work?

![Pasted image 20240227162717](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240227162717.png)

- System calls: OS receives requests from the application
- Commands: OS Issues commands to hardware
- Interrupts: OS handles hardware interrupts
- Upcalls: OS calls back the application

> OS seat quietely when free

> [!warning] Different from HARDWARE INTERRUPT
> 
> **Trap**: Generated by software
> - Error
> - User Request

### System Calls

- System calls provide the interface between a running program and the operating system
	- Generally available as assembly-language instructions
	- Languages defined to replace assembly language for systems programming allow system calls to be made directly (e.g., C, C++)
- **Three general methods** are used to **pass parameters** between a running program and the operating system
	- Pass parameters in ***registers***
		- Can be accessed by Running Program / OS
	- Store the parameters in a ***table in memory***, and the table address is passed as a parameter in a register
	- Push (store) the parameters onto the ***stack*** by the program, and pop off the stack by operating system
- Typically, a number associated with each system call
	- *Note: In linux, every call has an ID to recogonize the type*
	- System-call interface **maintains a table** indexed according to these numbers

#### Passing of Parameters As A Table

![Pasted image 20240227163240](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240227163240.png)

- Advantage
	- Fase
- Disadvantage
	- Small & Expensive

=> Cache store ***Address***
=> Access at Block / Table

- 5 or fewer paras: register
- more: address / stack

### Hardware Protection

- Dual-Mode Operation: Distinguish OS / User Program Ops (Authorization)
- I/O Protection (Previleage Op)
- Memory Protection (Certain process access certain address)
- CPU Protection (Certain duration, Certain process)

#### Dual-Mode Operation

- OS must provide hardware support to differentiate between at least two modes of operations
	1. User mode - execution done on behalf of a user
	2. Kernel/monitor mode - execution done on behalf of operating system
- Mode bit added to computer hardware to indicate the current mode:  
	*kernel (0) or user (1)*
	- Boot(Kernel Mode) => Start Application(User Mode)
- When an **interrupt or fault** occurs hardware switches to **kernel mode**
- **Previleged instructions**: can only be executed in **kernel mode**
	- Eg. File I/O, Interrupt management, Switching mode to K mode ...

> [!question] Two mode? Real / Protection Mode?

#### l/O Protection

- All I/O instructions are **privileged instructions**
- Must ensure that a user program could never gain control of the computer in kernel mode (I.e., a user program that, as part of its execution, stores a new address in the interrupt vector)

> ![../res/Pasted image 20240229153004.png](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240229153004.png)
> Use of A System Call to Perform I/O

#### Memory Protection

- Must provide memory protection at least for *the interrupt vector and the interrupt service routines*
- In order to have memory protection, at a minimum add two registers that determine the range of legal addresses a program may access:
	- **Base register** - holds the **smallest** legal physical memory address
	- **Limit register** - contains the size of the range
	- User can only access  address ranging **Base + Limit**
- Memory outside the defined range is protected

> 300040+120900=420940

#### Hardware Address Protection

![../res/Pasted image 20240229153306.png](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240229153306.png)

#### Hardware Protection

- When executing in **kernel mode**, the operating system has **unrestricted access** to both kernel and user's memory
- ==The **load instructions** for the *base* and *limit* registers are **privileged instructions**==

#### CPU Protection

- **Timer** - interrupts computer after specified period to ensure operating system **maintains control** (or when to maintain control)
	- Timer is decremented every clock tick
	- When timer reaches the value 0 , an interrupt occurs
	- *Prevent any process to use CPU resource infinitely*
- Timer commonly used to implement **time sharing**
- Timer also used to compute the current time
- Load-timer is a **privileged instruction**
