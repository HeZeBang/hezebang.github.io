## Machine Code, Assembly Code, High-level languages

![../res/Pasted image 20240226082842.png](../res/Pasted%20image%2020240226082842.png)

### Compiler & Interpreter

Compiler: Program Code -> Machine Code

- (C/C++ Compiler): Translate + Generate Executable File

Interpreter: special compiler

- Reads and executes program **directly**
- Do not generate executable file

[C/C++ Code VS Assembly Code](https://godbolt.org/z/4zWKhvd1P)

**Compilers**

Popular C/C++ compilers:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- MSVC (Microsoft Visual C compiler)
- Clang
- ICC (Intel C/C++ Compiler

Why C and C++?

- C is a high-level language that is closest to assembly.
- C++ "is as close to C as possible, but no closer".
- C++ is a language that
	- is a better C,
	- supports data abstraction,
	- and supports object oriented programming.
	- C and C++ are popular, powerful, general-purpose and efficient, and play an essential role in areas like systems programming, game engines development, high frequency trading, ...

## Standarlization of C and C++

üëç CS100 is based on **C17** and **C++17**.

[**cppreference**](https://www.cppreference.com)

Useful resources of [C](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/links) and [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/links)

### cppreference

The standard documentations are not friendly for learning:

- They aim to provide a precise definition of the language, instead of teaching the language.
- The chapters are not organized in a way suitable for learning.
- Changes between different standards are not shown in-place.

Cppreference is a complete online reference for the C and C++ languages and standard libraries.

- A more convenient and friendly version of the standards.

## Class Information

### Assessment

Homework 72\% + Midterm Exam 22\% + Quiz 4\% + Recitation attendance checks 2\%.

- No final exams
- No projects
- Homework assignments make up a large proportion!

### Recitations

- About 15 recitations
- 2 hours every week
- Include review of important contents, some extensions, homework/quiz/exam solutions, and some coding examples.
- **Attendance mandatory!** ( 2 \% in total)
- Videos will be available on Bilibili.

### Homework assignments

- 8 homework assignments:
	-  7 \%+7 \%+7 \%+11 \%+7 \%+11 \%+11 \%+11 \%= 72\% (may be adjusted)
- Submit through Online Judge!!!
	- Any other forms of submissions are not accepted, unless with special reasons.
	- For every problem, the score of the last submission will be taken as the final score.
- No plagiarism!!! The penalty will be heavy.
	- The TAs are really experienced. Don't take any chances.

### Quizzes

- 1 or 2 quizzes, 4 \% in total.
- During regular classes
- Time will not be announced in advance!

### Midterm exam

- 22 \%
- Will be held in the **13th ~ 15th** week
- Covers everything in regular classes and recitations, unless otherwise stated.
	- Ranging from the beginning to operator overloading (C++).
- Will not be too difficult. Don't worry.

### Textbooks and References

Recommended textbooks:

- C++ Primer (5th edition) **(NOT C + + Primer Plus!)** (based on C++11)
- Effective C++ (based on C++98), Effective Modern C++ (based on C++14)
- The C++ Programming Language (4th edition) (based on C++11), written by **Bjarne Stroustrup**, the inventor of C++

**All of the course materials conform to the C17 and C++17 standards, based on cppreference and the standard committee's papers.**

## Environment Setup

- VSCode + GCC (MinGW on Windows)
- Advanced tools may needed
