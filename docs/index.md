## Who am I

Hello! I'm Zebang He from **ShanghaiTech University**. As a **computer science undergraduate** at ShanghaiTech University with a demonstrated passion for **parallel computing** and **computer architecture**, I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in processor design and heterogeneous computing systems. My ultimate career goal is to pioneer energy-efficient architectures that bridge the gap between theoretical computational models and real-world performance demands.

## My Roles

- President of [GeekPie_ Association](https://github.com/ShanghaitechGeekPie/)
- Team leader of GeekPie_ HPC in **ASC 25**.
- Member of GeekPie_ HPC in **IndySCC 24**.
- Instructor of SI 100+, Intro to Computer Science

## My Projects

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### **PintOS**
    
    An operating system for the 80x86 architecture.
  
    ---
  
    - I implemented the advanced scheduling, system call, user/kernel mode, virtual memory and file system of the operating   system.
    - PintOS contains basic shell and filesystem, and is able to run programs in user mode.
  
-   ### **OATC**
  
    A simple language compiler for the OATC language.
  
    ---
  
    - I implemented an X86lite instruction set simulator and assembler. And the OATC language interpreter using OCaml.
    - I've also developed the compiler from OATC to LLVMlite IR, and final to X86lite platform.
  
-   ### **Tiny CPU with ZASM**
  
    A simple CPU with ZASM which defined by myself.
  
    ---
  
    - I designed a simple CPU which is turing complete, and it supports 8-bit instructions and interger calculations. It   contains 8 registers and 256 bytes of memory.
    - I made a simple instruction set and named it "ZASM", it contains 20+ instructions, including function calls, jumps and   basic arithmetic and logic operations.
  
-   ### CatLin
  
    CatLin is a Deadline Manager with Kawaii Interface
